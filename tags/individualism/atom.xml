      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyranny of the Collective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day at work, someone asked me why I’m anti-union. It wasn’t an aggressive question, just an honest one. But it caught me slightly off guard. So I thought it was worth setting down, clearly and candidly, why I oppose unions—not out of spite or contrarianism, but because I believe they do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when trade unions might have served a purpose. I can admit that. In the shadow of the Industrial Revolution, when the worker was more or less a replaceable cog in the machinery of capital, the idea of collective action held a certain rough justice. But like many ideas born in the furnace of necessity, the union has long outlived its usefulness in modern England. It now stands not as a bulwark for the oppressed, but as a sclerotic relic that throttles initiative, undermines merit, and entrenches mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
