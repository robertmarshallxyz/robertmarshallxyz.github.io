      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I Write to Stay Sane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I write because it is the only way to keep my mind intact. Thought left unexamined tends toward disorder. Impressions accumulate, anxieties multiply, contradictions press in, and the edges of consciousness grow brittle. Writing is the method by which I impose structure on this turbulence, a way to confront what would otherwise overwhelm me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The necessity of this practice is reinforced by reading. Solzhenitsyn, in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Ward&lt;/em&gt;, depicts a world in which thought and survival are inseparable; to fail to order the mind is to court ruin. Proust demonstrates that memory cannot be trusted unless it is articulated; without recording, experience dissolves or distorts. Hegel, in &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, traces consciousness through contradiction, showing that understanding is earned, not granted. Writing allows me to internalise these lessons, enacting the discipline they demand, negotiating my own mental landscape with precision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
