      <title>Through the Labyrinth of Consciousness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the Labyrinth of Consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are books one reads, and then there are books one is read by. Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; belongs to the latter. It is less a text to be consumed than an experience to be undergone—a slow, disorienting, and often maddening unraveling of the self, which ends, if one persists, not in clarity, but in a transformation of perspective so total that clarity no longer means what it once did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How We Lost Control and Learned Nothing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Lost Control and Learned Nothing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stanley Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/em&gt; is often praised as a masterclass in satire, a barbed commentary on Cold War paranoia and military absurdity. But it is more than a film about nuclear weapons. It is a study in delegation—a portrait of what happens when men place machines between themselves and responsibility. Though made in 1964, long before neural nets and reinforcement learning, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/em&gt; is arguably more prescient about artificial intelligence than most of the fiction written with that label.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Rule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Geometry of Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; not out of admiration but suspicion. Its reputation preceded it like a dagger in a dim alley—&lt;em&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/em&gt;, after all, is a byword for cunning, deceit, and political amorality. Yet on reading the slim volume, I was struck not by wickedness, but by clarity. Machiavelli does not corrupt virtue; he strips it of illusion. He writes with the detachment of a surgeon, cutting away the fat of moral sentiment to expose the sinews of power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machinery of Men</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/machinery-of-men/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Machinery of Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people, if they have heard of Adam Smith at all, know him as the man who spoke of an &amp;ldquo;invisible hand.&amp;rdquo; That phrase has taken on a life of its own—half cliché, half ideology—uttered by those who have never opened &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps never will. I approached it out of a sense of obligation, as one might visit a grave: not expecting conversation, only reflection. But I found something else entirely. This was no dry treatise. It was a work of political philosophy clothed in the language of trade and tariffs, a forensic examination of human nature conducted through the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heart’s Reason</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/hearts-reason/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart’s Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain kind of book which one reads not as one reads a novel or even a work of philosophy, but as one overhears a man murmuring to himself in the dark. Blaise Pascal’s &lt;em&gt;Pensées&lt;/em&gt; is such a book. It is not a treatise, not even really a book in the conventional sense, but a collection of notes—scattered thoughts written down in preparation for an apology for the Christian religion that was never completed. What survives is all the more powerful for being fragmentary. It reads like a mind on fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
