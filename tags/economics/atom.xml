      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Machinery of Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people, if they have heard of Adam Smith at all, know him as the man who spoke of an &amp;ldquo;invisible hand.&amp;rdquo; That phrase has taken on a life of its own—half cliché, half ideology—uttered by those who have never opened &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps never will. I approached it out of a sense of obligation, as one might visit a grave: not expecting conversation, only reflection. But I found something else entirely. This was no dry treatise. It was a work of political philosophy clothed in the language of trade and tariffs, a forensic examination of human nature conducted through the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
