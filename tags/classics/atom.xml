      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Geometry of Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; not out of admiration but suspicion. Its reputation preceded it like a dagger in a dim alley—&lt;em&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/em&gt;, after all, is a byword for cunning, deceit, and political amorality. Yet on reading the slim volume, I was struck not by wickedness, but by clarity. Machiavelli does not corrupt virtue; he strips it of illusion. He writes with the detachment of a surgeon, cutting away the fat of moral sentiment to expose the sinews of power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machinery of Men</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Machinery of Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people, if they have heard of Adam Smith at all, know him as the man who spoke of an &amp;ldquo;invisible hand.&amp;rdquo; That phrase has taken on a life of its own—half cliché, half ideology—uttered by those who have never opened &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps never will. I approached it out of a sense of obligation, as one might visit a grave: not expecting conversation, only reflection. But I found something else entirely. This was no dry treatise. It was a work of political philosophy clothed in the language of trade and tariffs, a forensic examination of human nature conducted through the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
