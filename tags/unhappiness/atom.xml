      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have often noticed, with a quiet but persistent discomfort, how easy it is to disappear into myself without even realising it. Not physically, of course, but psychologically, emotionally, morally. There is a subtle, almost imperceptible erosion that occurs when I keep my unhappiness unspoken, when I convince myself that silence is a virtue. Each day I swallow what I feel, push down irritation, tuck disappointment behind polite smiles. The cost is invisible at first. My actions appear orderly, my life functional. But inside, a slow corrosion begins, eating away at the contours of who I am. The self I believe intact begins to fray. I notice, too late, that endurance without articulation is not strength but dissolution. What is left is a reflection of what I imagine others expect me to be, a shadow of the person I know I am. This shadow moves through the day, interacting with the world as though it were sufficient, while the real self grows muted, shrinking under its own containment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
