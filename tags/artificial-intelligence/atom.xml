      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Lost Control and Learned Nothing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stanley Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/em&gt; is often praised as a masterclass in satire, a barbed commentary on Cold War paranoia and military absurdity. But it is more than a film about nuclear weapons. It is a study in delegation—a portrait of what happens when men place machines between themselves and responsibility. Though made in 1964, long before neural nets and reinforcement learning, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/em&gt; is arguably more prescient about artificial intelligence than most of the fiction written with that label.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
