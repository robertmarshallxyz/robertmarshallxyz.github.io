    <p><strong>Wrath of Achilles</strong></p>
<p>The first line strikes like a war trumpet: <em>“Sing, goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans.”</em> I remember rereading it aloud one evening, the ancient words pressing themselves onto my tongue like incantations. This anger—<em>mēnin</em>—is no petty grievance but something elemental, corrosive, and divine. From the outset, Homer does not present war as glorious or redemptive, but as a theatre of rage and loss, governed by capricious gods and fragile men.</p>
<p>The <em>Iliad</em> is often mistaken for a story about the Trojan War. But it isn’t, not exactly. The war, ten years long, sits in the background. The poem instead takes place over a mere few weeks and is obsessively focused on one man’s fury. Achilles’ withdrawal from battle after being slighted by Agamemnon—the commander who takes the war-prize Briseis from him—sets into motion a spiralling tragedy. This is not anger in the modern sense. It is closer to a kind of existential wound. Achilles, aware of his mortality and robbed of his honour, becomes like a god in power and yet utterly human in his despair.</p>
<p>When Hector slays Patroclus, Achilles’ friend or perhaps something more intimate, grief cracks open his rage. What follows is a transformation: <em>“So let me die at once, since it was not my fate to save my comrade.”</em> Homer makes no attempt to comfort us. Achilles returns to war not for victory, nor even for vengeance, but because he has nothing left. He becomes the embodiment of fate—terrible and unrelenting. His killing of Hector is surgical and inevitable, yet when he drags the corpse round Patroclus’ tomb, we sense a man no longer quite human.</p>
<p>But then, something astonishing happens. Priam, the Trojan king, enters the Greek camp. He kneels before the killer of his son and kisses his hands: <em>“I have done what no man has done—I have kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.”</em> Achilles, moved by the sight of a grieving father, weeps. The wrath that scorched the earth is, for a moment, stilled. They eat together. They grieve together. In that fragile moment, we see the possibility of civilisation.</p>
<p>What has always haunted me is how the <em>Iliad</em> ends not in triumph or resolution, but in a funeral. Hector is mourned. The wheel of vengeance pauses, not because justice has prevailed, but because grief reminds both Greeks and Trojans that they are men. And men die.</p>
<p>Reading the <em>Iliad</em> is not a lesson in glory, but in the cost of anger, and the rare, luminous flicker of humanity that survives amid the smoke of war.</p>
