    <p><strong>Man of Many Turns</strong></p>
<p>I have always preferred <em>nostos</em> to <em>kleos</em>. The <em>Iliad</em> dazzles, yes, but the <em>Odyssey</em> lingers. It is quieter, more cunning, and in many ways, sadder. If the <em>Iliad</em> concerns what it means to die well, then the <em>Odyssey</em> is concerned with how one might live afterward.</p>
<p><em>“Tell me, Muse, of the man of many turns, who wandered far after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy.”</em> Odysseus is not praised for his strength, but for his <em>polytropos</em>—his turning mind, his adaptability, his duplicity. He is a man perpetually becoming, never quite at rest. His journey home becomes a labyrinth not of distance but of identity.</p>
<p>There is a profound loneliness to the <em>Odyssey</em>. Odysseus moves from one strange world to another—the Cyclopes, Circe, the Land of the Dead, Calypso’s isle—and with each encounter, he is tempted to abandon his return. What would it mean to stay forever in a place where time does not pass, where desire is fulfilled? Calypso offers him immortality, and yet he weeps each morning, gazing out at the sea.</p>
<p>Odysseus&rsquo; refusal is deeply human. He does not want eternity. He wants home. But home is not what it was. His son has grown up without him; his wife has lived in mourning; his palace is overrun with lecherous suitors. The man who left Ithaca as a victorious king returns in disguise, uncertain whether he will be recognised. <em>“Stranger,” says Penelope, not yet knowing him, “you remind me of my husband.”</em> Recognition is partial, cautious.</p>
<p>The poem’s final test—Odysseus’ stringing of the bow—is more than an assertion of strength. It is a reassertion of self. After twenty years, he proves not just that he is Odysseus, but that the world he left can still hold him. And yet even then, blood must flow. The suitors are slaughtered, the servants punished. Only after this purging can peace be brokered, and the house made whole.</p>
<p>But I do not read the <em>Odyssey</em> as a triumph. It is, like all great epics, a kind of lament. Odysseus survives everything—storms, monsters, gods—but he returns as a ghost of himself. He has learned too much. <em>“I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, known to the world for every kind of wile.”</em> Even at the end, his identity is inseparable from trickery, his homecoming a performance as much as a return.</p>
<p>To read the <em>Odyssey</em> is to watch a man walk backwards into his own life, uncertain whether he still belongs. It is not a tale of homecoming, but a reminder that one cannot step into the same river twice—even if the river flows to Ithaca.</p>
