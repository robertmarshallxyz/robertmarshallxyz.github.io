    <p><strong>Revolutionary’s Reply</strong></p>
<p>I first read <em>Rights of Man</em> with a sense of cautious admiration. After all, Thomas Paine had already startled me with <em>Common Sense</em>—a pamphlet as incendiary as it was persuasive. But <em>Rights of Man</em> was different. It bore the confidence of a man who had not only seen a revolution succeed but now sought to defend its principles against the sneers of an old order clinging to its inherited privilege. Where <em>Common Sense</em> had spoken to the discontented colonist, <em>Rights of Man</em> addresses a broader, more dangerous question: what gives any government the right to rule?</p>
<p>Paine’s answer is simple and profound—government exists only by the consent of the governed. This idea, which now adorns high school civics classrooms and political campaign slogans, was in Paine’s day nothing short of heretical. And it was Edmund Burke’s <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> that provoked him. Burke, with his disdain for the masses and romantic idealisation of aristocratic tradition, struck Paine as not merely mistaken but morally obscene. Burke wept, Paine remarked acidly, not for the starving French peasantry, but for the loss of gilded furniture at Versailles.</p>
<p>It is in these pages that Paine does what few writers truly achieve—he turns moral clarity into political argument. <em>Rights of Man</em> is not a dry treatise; it is an assault, and a joyful one at that. “Man has no property in man,” he declares, “neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow.” With that sentence alone, he dispatches both monarchy and hereditary privilege. He sees government not as an inheritance but as a contract—renewable, revocable, and subject always to the will of the people. It is the sort of thinking that made kings tremble and scaffold builders prosperous.</p>
<p>But what lingers with me, beyond his invective against the aristocracy, is Paine’s optimism. He is, above all, a believer—in reason, in the innate moral sense of mankind, in the perfectibility of political arrangements. He writes not in despair but in hope. He genuinely believes that justice can be made universal and that the poor may live with dignity if only power is wrested from the grasping hands of the few. This is what most sharply distinguishes him from Burke. Where Burke warns of chaos, Paine dreams of order built anew—order based not on bloodlines and precedent, but on rights and reason.</p>
<p>It is fashionable now to regard such optimism with suspicion. Our age is more likely to speak of “managing decline” than achieving progress. We mistrust grand narratives, revolutions, and all talk of natural rights. And yet there is something bracing, even necessary, in revisiting Paine. He reminds us that society need not be a gilded cage maintained by inherited rules, that authority must always justify itself, and that suffering is not made sacred by age.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Rights of Man</em> is not without flaws. Paine sometimes veers into idealism so abstract that it overlooks the tragic complexity of history. His vision of democratic government, though admirable, seems to assume a kind of rational consensus that experience rarely bears out. The revolutionary spirit, once uncorked, does not always follow the path of reason. The French Revolution itself, which Paine defends so vigorously, would soon give way to the guillotine, the Terror, and eventually Napoleon.</p>
<p>And yet, I cannot dismiss him. His failings are the failings of a man who believed too much in the dignity of his fellow man, not too little. That is no sin in my eyes. Better that than the cold conservatism that would prefer stability over justice, continuity over conscience.</p>
<p>In the final pages, Paine imagines a world in which government is reduced in cost and increased in effectiveness, in which poverty is alleviated through pensions and education, and in which war is rendered obsolete by mutual interest. It reads less like prophecy than utopia. But it is a <em>moral</em> utopia—not a fantasy of domination, but a hope for liberation. Paine is not dreaming of empires but of citizens.</p>
<p>There is something deeply moving in that, especially now, when so much of political discourse is rooted in cynicism, tribalism, and fear. Paine believed that freedom was not a luxury to be granted but a right to be reclaimed. He never asked for permission. He spoke to the dispossessed, the voiceless, and the future.</p>
<p>As I closed <em>Rights of Man</em>, I felt again the uneasy admiration I had carried from <em>Common Sense</em>. Paine is not comfortable company. He challenges. He provokes. He insists. But in doing so, he preserves something essential—that radical, difficult belief that people, if trusted and free, can govern themselves. We would do well to hear him again.</p>
