    <p><strong>Tyranny of the Collective</strong></p>
<p>The other day at work, someone asked me why I’m anti-union. It wasn’t an aggressive question, just an honest one. But it caught me slightly off guard. So I thought it was worth setting down, clearly and candidly, why I oppose unions—not out of spite or contrarianism, but because I believe they do more harm than good.</p>
<p>There was a time when trade unions might have served a purpose. I can admit that. In the shadow of the Industrial Revolution, when the worker was more or less a replaceable cog in the machinery of capital, the idea of collective action held a certain rough justice. But like many ideas born in the furnace of necessity, the union has long outlived its usefulness in modern England. It now stands not as a bulwark for the oppressed, but as a sclerotic relic that throttles initiative, undermines merit, and entrenches mediocrity.</p>
<p>The union, in theory, protects the worker from exploitation. In practice, it protects the least productive from accountability.</p>
<p>In my experience—and here I speak not in abstractions but from what I’ve observed repeatedly—unions frequently behave as if the mere existence of hierarchy is an injustice. The manager becomes the enemy; the employer, a tyrant. What follows is an adversarial mindset baked into the very culture of the workplace. It is not dialogue that unions seek, but dominance. Their negotiations are not partnerships, but threats: give us what we demand, or face disruption.</p>
<p>What this breeds is not solidarity but stagnation. I’ve seen industrious, capable individuals stifled because the union insists that everyone be treated “equally”—which almost always means treating the best like the worst. Reward becomes decoupled from effort. Laziness is shielded, initiative punished. The result is a workforce that becomes demoralised, cynical, and indifferent.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this clearer than in the public sector. In England, our schools, hospitals, and prisons are riddled with union influence. The result? Strikes that endanger the public, protections for staff who are manifestly incompetent, and a bureaucratic ossification that makes meaningful reform almost impossible. Try removing a failing teacher or disciplining a negligent nurse, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself not in a conversation about standards, but in a Kafkaesque procedural labyrinth designed to preserve the status quo—regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Unions also peddle a fundamentally collectivist vision of society. They assume that the individual is powerless, that the only moral good is group identity, and that conflict is the natural state of economic life. It’s a Marxist hangover dressed up in high-vis jackets and megaphones. The damage is not only economic but moral. It teaches people that their primary identity is as victims. That they are owed a living, rather than responsible for earning one.</p>
<p>And then there is the political entanglement. Unions in England are not content to represent workers—they seek to govern them. Their leadership often appears less interested in improving conditions than in shaping society itself, invariably in the image of the left. They function as voting blocs, campaign arms, ideological enforcers. Many English unions behave as if they were above democracy—insulated from consequence, unanswerable to those they claim to serve.</p>
<p>What’s the alternative? Personal responsibility. Voluntary association. The belief that hard work and good character should count for more than seniority or affiliation. A society in which individuals are free to bargain for themselves, rise on their merits, and face the consequences of their actions—without a collectivist intermediary enforcing conformity.</p>
<p>To oppose unions in modern England is not to be anti-worker. It is to be pro-individual, pro-responsibility, and pro-excellence. It is to believe that the dignity of work lies not in shouting through bullhorns or withdrawing labour like a hostage-taker, but in showing up, doing one’s best, and being rewarded accordingly.</p>
<p>The union once fought for freedom. Today, it fights to preserve mediocrity. I, for one, am no longer willing to pretend otherwise.</p>
