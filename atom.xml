      <title>Why I Write to Stay Sane</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I Write to Stay Sane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I write because it is the only way to keep my mind intact. Thought left unexamined tends toward disorder. Impressions accumulate, anxieties multiply, contradictions press in, and the edges of consciousness grow brittle. Writing is the method by which I impose structure on this turbulence, a way to confront what would otherwise overwhelm me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The necessity of this practice is reinforced by reading. Solzhenitsyn, in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Ward&lt;/em&gt;, depicts a world in which thought and survival are inseparable; to fail to order the mind is to court ruin. Proust demonstrates that memory cannot be trusted unless it is articulated; without recording, experience dissolves or distorts. Hegel, in &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt;, traces consciousness through contradiction, showing that understanding is earned, not granted. Writing allows me to internalise these lessons, enacting the discipline they demand, negotiating my own mental landscape with precision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tyranny of the Collective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyranny of the Collective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day at work, someone asked me why I’m anti-union. It wasn’t an aggressive question, just an honest one. But it caught me slightly off guard. So I thought it was worth setting down, clearly and candidly, why I oppose unions—not out of spite or contrarianism, but because I believe they do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when trade unions might have served a purpose. I can admit that. In the shadow of the Industrial Revolution, when the worker was more or less a replaceable cog in the machinery of capital, the idea of collective action held a certain rough justice. But like many ideas born in the furnace of necessity, the union has long outlived its usefulness in modern England. It now stands not as a bulwark for the oppressed, but as a sclerotic relic that throttles initiative, undermines merit, and entrenches mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine and the Soul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine and the Soul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern man has inherited a world that promises convenience and delivers compliance. We are told we are freer than ever, yet everywhere we find ourselves managed—by bureaucracies, algorithms, psychological assessments, and false choices preordained by systems that presume to know us better than we know ourselves. This is not freedom. It is domestication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The machine—the vast network of institutions, ideologies, and devices that govern modern life—does not threaten us in the old ways. It no longer needs to ban books or jail dissidents. It simply distracts us, flatters us, diagnoses us, and nudges us until we mistake obedience for choice and sedation for peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Through the Labyrinth of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/through-the-labyrinth-of-consciousness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the Labyrinth of Consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are books one reads, and then there are books one is read by. Hegel’s &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology of Spirit&lt;/em&gt; belongs to the latter. It is less a text to be consumed than an experience to be undergone—a slow, disorienting, and often maddening unraveling of the self, which ends, if one persists, not in clarity, but in a transformation of perspective so total that clarity no longer means what it once did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How We Lost Control and Learned Nothing</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/how-we-lost-control-and-learned-nothing/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/how-we-lost-control-and-learned-nothing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How We Lost Control and Learned Nothing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stanley Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&lt;/em&gt; is often praised as a masterclass in satire, a barbed commentary on Cold War paranoia and military absurdity. But it is more than a film about nuclear weapons. It is a study in delegation—a portrait of what happens when men place machines between themselves and responsibility. Though made in 1964, long before neural nets and reinforcement learning, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/em&gt; is arguably more prescient about artificial intelligence than most of the fiction written with that label.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wrath of Achilles</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/wrath-of-achilles/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrath of Achilles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first line strikes like a war trumpet: &lt;em&gt;“Sing, goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans.”&lt;/em&gt; I remember rereading it aloud one evening, the ancient words pressing themselves onto my tongue like incantations. This anger—&lt;em&gt;mēnin&lt;/em&gt;—is no petty grievance but something elemental, corrosive, and divine. From the outset, Homer does not present war as glorious or redemptive, but as a theatre of rage and loss, governed by capricious gods and fragile men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Rule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Geometry of Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt; not out of admiration but suspicion. Its reputation preceded it like a dagger in a dim alley—&lt;em&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/em&gt;, after all, is a byword for cunning, deceit, and political amorality. Yet on reading the slim volume, I was struck not by wickedness, but by clarity. Machiavelli does not corrupt virtue; he strips it of illusion. He writes with the detachment of a surgeon, cutting away the fat of moral sentiment to expose the sinews of power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machinery of Men</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/machinery-of-men/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Machinery of Men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people, if they have heard of Adam Smith at all, know him as the man who spoke of an &amp;ldquo;invisible hand.&amp;rdquo; That phrase has taken on a life of its own—half cliché, half ideology—uttered by those who have never opened &lt;em&gt;The Wealth of Nations&lt;/em&gt; and perhaps never will. I approached it out of a sense of obligation, as one might visit a grave: not expecting conversation, only reflection. But I found something else entirely. This was no dry treatise. It was a work of political philosophy clothed in the language of trade and tariffs, a forensic examination of human nature conducted through the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revolutionary’s Reply</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutionary’s Reply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;Rights of Man&lt;/em&gt; with a sense of cautious admiration. After all, Thomas Paine had already startled me with &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt;—a pamphlet as incendiary as it was persuasive. But &lt;em&gt;Rights of Man&lt;/em&gt; was different. It bore the confidence of a man who had not only seen a revolution succeed but now sought to defend its principles against the sneers of an old order clinging to its inherited privilege. Where &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt; had spoken to the discontented colonist, &lt;em&gt;Rights of Man&lt;/em&gt; addresses a broader, more dangerous question: what gives any government the right to rule?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heart’s Reason</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart’s Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain kind of book which one reads not as one reads a novel or even a work of philosophy, but as one overhears a man murmuring to himself in the dark. Blaise Pascal’s &lt;em&gt;Pensées&lt;/em&gt; is such a book. It is not a treatise, not even really a book in the conventional sense, but a collection of notes—scattered thoughts written down in preparation for an apology for the Christian religion that was never completed. What survives is all the more powerful for being fragmentary. It reads like a mind on fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Firebrand’s Voice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firebrand&amp;rsquo;s Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some books that strike like a thunderclap when they first appear—forceful, unexpected, and impossible to ignore. Thomas Paine’s &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt; is one such work. When I first read it, I could almost hear the sound of it echoing through the narrow colonial streets of Philadelphia, rattling pews and dinner tables alike. Though clothed in the plain garments of pamphleteering, Paine’s tract is nothing less than a fierce argument for the transformation of an entire world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Man of Many Turns</title>
      <link>https://robertmarshall.xyz/writings/a-man-of-many-turns/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man of Many Turns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have always preferred &lt;em&gt;nostos&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;kleos&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; dazzles, yes, but the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; lingers. It is quieter, more cunning, and in many ways, sadder. If the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; concerns what it means to die well, then the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is concerned with how one might live afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Tell me, Muse, of the man of many turns, who wandered far after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy.”&lt;/em&gt; Odysseus is not praised for his strength, but for his &lt;em&gt;polytropos&lt;/em&gt;—his turning mind, his adaptability, his duplicity. He is a man perpetually becoming, never quite at rest. His journey home becomes a labyrinth not of distance but of identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of humanity&amp;rsquo;s problems stem from man&amp;rsquo;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Blaise Pascal&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That line has haunted me for years — not because it’s poetic, but because it’s true. I’ve found that clarity begins in silence, and most problems begin when we try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spend my time reading old books, writing essays, and building systems that don’t fall apart. My interests sit at the intersection of structure and meaning: data, decentralisation, security, and the kinds of ideas that linger long after the page is closed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
